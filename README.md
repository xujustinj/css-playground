# CSS Playground

This playground contains a bunch of CSS techniques I've accumulated over time.

Every HTML file is a standalone example with inline styles. Converting the code to something worthy of a production website is an exercise left to the reader.

## Examples

- [Upside-Down](upside-down.html)
    - bottom-to-top layouts with `flex-direction: column-reverse`
    - defining an `onload` function to scroll to page bottom
